⦁	Step 4: Replace the Product Type for sock groups.
⦁		Take the path of the file to change.
⦁		Look in Column G - known as 'Type'
⦁		Take a user input for what we will change the values to.
⦁		Respect the header but change everything else.

Step 5: Build a size mapping dictionary for the products
⦁	Extract all sizes, deduplicate
⦁	Put in a master sequential list
⦁	Send to Gemma for categorization (define the threshold)

Kids: 12M
Womens: 36-40 (S/M)
Mens: 41-46 (M/L)




⦁	Step 4: Append new genders to the file.
⦁		For column CQ ('Metafield: custom.gender [list.single_line_text_field]')

Other columns:
	
⦁		For column DE ('Metafield: shopify.target-gender [list.metaobject_reference]')
⦁		For all men's, we must APPEND women's - get the format right.
⦁		For column EN ('Metafield: customAttributes.gender [single_line_text_field]')
